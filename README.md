# Tools for Job Searching

Small scripts and programs to help with job searching.

## Linkedin

Job searching on Linkedin often shows a lot of Promoted results that are not relevant to your search. Often, they don't contain the keyword that you searched for. For example, I searched for Spanish and it showed 20 Promoted (out of 25) results that were not relevant or didn't contain that keyword anywhere.

This JS code removes Promoted results from a Linkedin job search.

See details in `linkedin/remove-promoted-job-results.js`
